# Claude Progress Log - telegram-365-bot

## Session 11 - 2025-01-13

### Status: BLOCKED - Missing app_spec.txt

**This is the 11th consecutive session blocked by the same issue.**

**Verified state:**
- Features in database: **0** (confirmed via `feature_get_stats`)
- `prompts/app_spec.txt`: **Does not exist**
- Files in prompts/: `coding_prompt.md`, `coding_prompt_yolo.md`, `initializer_prompt.md`
- `initializer_prompt.md` still contains `[FEATURE_COUNT]` placeholder (unconfigured)

**The autonomous agent CANNOT proceed without a project specification.**

### Why This Project Is Blocked:

The project was created but the specification process was never completed. Without `app_spec.txt`, the system doesn't know:
- What the Telegram bot should do
- What commands it should support
- What features need to be implemented
- What integrations are required

### To Unblock This Project:

**Run the spec creation command:**
```
/create-spec telegram-365-bot
```

This will start an interactive conversation to define:
- Bot purpose and main functionality
- Commands users can send to the bot
- Admin interface (if needed)
- Integrations and data storage

Once completed, the specification files will be created and the autonomous agent can begin building.

## Session 10 - 2025-01-13

### Status: BLOCKED - Missing app_spec.txt

**This is the 10th consecutive session blocked by the same issue.**

**Verified state:**
- Features in database: **0** (confirmed via `feature_get_stats`)
- `prompts/app_spec.txt`: **Does not exist**
- Files in prompts/: `coding_prompt.md`, `coding_prompt_yolo.md`, `initializer_prompt.md`
- `initializer_prompt.md` still contains `[FEATURE_COUNT]` placeholder

**The autonomous agent cannot proceed without a project specification.**

### To Create the Specification:

**Option 1: Interactive Spec Creation (Recommended)**
```
/create-spec telegram-365-bot
```

This will start an interactive conversation to define:
- What the Telegram bot does
- Bot commands and features
- Whether there's a web admin interface
- Required integrations and data storage

**Option 2: Manual Spec Creation**
Create `prompts/app_spec.txt` following the XML schema with complete project requirements.

### What Happens After Spec Creation:

1. **Initializer Agent** runs first to:
   - Read the spec
   - Create features in database using `feature_create_bulk`
   - Set up project structure
   - Create `init.sh`
   - Initialize git repository

2. **Coding Agent** runs in subsequent sessions to:
   - Implement features one by one
   - Test with browser automation
   - Mark features as passing

## Session 9 - 2025-01-13

### Status: BLOCKED - Missing app_spec.txt

**Same blocking issue persists for the 9th consecutive session.**

**Verified state:**
- Features in database: **0** (confirmed via `feature_get_stats`)
- `prompts/app_spec.txt`: **Does not exist**
- Files in prompts/: `coding_prompt.md`, `coding_prompt_yolo.md`, `initializer_prompt.md`

**This project cannot proceed without a specification.** The autonomous coding agent has no definition of what to build.

### Action Required by User:

To create a specification for this Telegram bot, the user must define:
1. **What the bot does** - Its purpose and main functionality
2. **Bot commands** - What commands users can send
3. **Features** - What capabilities should the bot have
4. **Web UI** - Whether there's an admin dashboard or web interface
5. **Integrations** - Any external APIs or services

**Options to proceed:**

**Option 1: Run spec creation command**
```
/create-spec telegram-365-bot
```

**Option 2: Manually create the spec**
Create `prompts/app_spec.txt` with the project specification in XML format.

## Session 8 - 2025-01-13

### Status: BLOCKED - Missing app_spec.txt

**Same blocking issue persists.** Verified once again:
- Features in database: **0** (confirmed via `feature_get_stats`)
- `prompts/app_spec.txt`: **Does not exist**
- Files in prompts/: `coding_prompt.md`, `coding_prompt_yolo.md`, `initializer_prompt.md`

**This project cannot begin without a specification.** The autonomous coding agent needs to know what to build.

**Action Required:**
```
/create-spec telegram-365-bot
```

This will:
1. Ask what the Telegram bot should do
2. Generate `prompts/app_spec.txt`
3. Update `initializer_prompt.md` with feature count
4. Enable the autonomous agent to start building

---

## Session 7 - 2025-01-13

### Status: BLOCKED - Missing app_spec.txt

**Verified state for the 7th consecutive session:**
- Features in database: **0** (confirmed via `feature_get_stats`)
- `prompts/app_spec.txt`: **Does not exist**
- Files in prompts/: `coding_prompt.md`, `coding_prompt_yolo.md`, `initializer_prompt.md`

**This project cannot proceed without a specification.** The autonomous coding agent has no definition of what to build.

**Action Required for User:**

Run the spec creation process by typing:
```
/create-spec telegram-365-bot
```

This interactive process will:
1. Ask what the Telegram bot should do (features, commands, purpose)
2. Generate `prompts/app_spec.txt` with complete technical specification
3. Update `initializer_prompt.md` with feature count
4. Create `.spec_status.json` to enable "Continue to Project" button

**Note:** Until the specification is created, no coding work can begin. The agent has nothing to implement.

---

## Session 6 - 2025-01-13

### Status: BLOCKED - Missing app_spec.txt

**Same blocking issue persists across 6 sessions now.** This project cannot proceed because:

1. **`prompts/app_spec.txt` does not exist** - The specification was never created
2. **Features database has 0 features** - Cannot run Coding Agent without features
3. **`initializer_prompt.md` has `[FEATURE_COUNT]` placeholder** - Unconfigured

**Current State (verified):**
- `features.db`: 0 passing, 0 in_progress, 0 total
- `prompts/` directory only contains template files (no app_spec.txt)
- Git repository: Part of parent autocoder repo

**REQUIRED ACTION:**

The user **must** run the spec creation process:

```
/create-spec telegram-365-bot
```

This will:
1. Start an interactive conversation about what the Telegram bot should do
2. Generate `prompts/app_spec.txt` with the complete specification
3. Update `initializer_prompt.md` with the actual feature count
4. Write `.spec_status.json` to signal completion

**Until this is done, the autonomous agent cannot proceed.** There's nothing to build without knowing what the project is.

---

## Session 5 - 2025-01-13

### Status: BLOCKED - Missing app_spec.txt

**Same issue as previous sessions.** Cannot proceed because `prompts/app_spec.txt` does not exist.

**Project State:**
- Features in database: **0** (verified via feature_get_stats)
- app_spec.txt: **MISSING** (file does not exist)
- Git repository: Part of parent autocoder repo (no separate repo initialized)

**Action Required:**
The user must create a project specification before the autonomous agent can work. Run:
```
/create-spec telegram-365-bot
```

This will start an interactive conversation to define:
- What the Telegram bot does
- What commands/features it should have
- Technical requirements and integrations
- Feature count for implementation

Once the spec is created, the Initializer Agent will:
1. Read the specification
2. Create features in the database using `feature_create_bulk`
3. Set up the project structure
4. Initialize git and create `init.sh`

---

## Session 4 - 2025-01-13

### Status: BLOCKED - Missing app_spec.txt

**Cannot proceed with Coding Agent work.** This is still an initializer project (0 features) but the specification file `prompts/app_spec.txt` has never been created.

**To unblock this project, the user must:**

1. Run the `/create-spec` slash command in Claude Code
2. Follow the interactive prompts to define the Telegram bot's purpose, features, and functionality
3. The spec creation will generate `prompts/app_spec.txt` and update the feature count in `initializer_prompt.md`
4. Then the autonomous agent can proceed with the Initializer Agent role to create features and set up the project

**Note:** The Coding Agent cannot "invent" a spec - we need the user to define what this "telegram-365-bot" should actually do.

---

## Session 3 - 2025-01-13

### Status: BLOCKED - Missing app_spec.txt

This is an **initializer session** (0 features in database), but cannot proceed because:

1. **`prompts/app_spec.txt` does not exist** - The specification file was never created
2. **`initializer_prompt.md` has placeholder** - `[FEATURE_COUNT]` was never replaced with actual count

### Current Project State:
- Features in database: **0**
- app_spec.txt: **MISSING**
- initializer_prompt.md: Has `[FEATURE_COUNT]` placeholder (unconfigured)
- Git repository: Exists (from parent autocoder project)

### Files Present:
- `prompts/coding_prompt.md` - Template for coding sessions
- `prompts/coding_prompt_yolo.md` - YOLO mode template
- `prompts/initializer_prompt.md` - Initializer template (needs feature count)

### What Needs to Happen:

**Option 1: Run spec creation (Recommended)**
The user should run the `/create-spec` slash command to:
1. Define what this Telegram bot should do
2. Generate `prompts/app_spec.txt` with full specification
3. Update `initializer_prompt.md` with the feature count
4. Write `.spec_status.json` to signal completion

**Option 2: Manually create spec**
The user can manually create `prompts/app_spec.txt` following the XML schema and update the feature count in `initializer_prompt.md`.

### For the Spec Creation - Questions to Answer:
- What is this Telegram bot for?
- What commands will it support?
- Will it have a web admin interface?
- What integrations does it need (APIs, databases, etc.)?
- Any user roles or permissions?
- What data does it track/store?

### What the Initializer Agent Will Do (Once Spec Exists):
1. Read `app_spec.txt` to understand the project
2. Create features in database using `feature_create_bulk`
3. Create `init.sh` for environment setup
4. Initialize git repository with initial commit
5. Create basic project structure
6. Optionally start implementing first feature

### Technical Notes:
- The git log shows this is inside the parent autocoder repository
- A separate git repository should be initialized for this specific project
- SQLite database `features.db` exists but is empty (0 features)
